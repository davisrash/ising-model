  \section{Introduction}
  The transverse-field Ising model is a quantum mechanical model of a spin lattice and can be solved exactly on a quantum computer~\cite{CerveraLierta18}. In one dimension, the Hamiltonian describing the model is given by
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:system-hamiltonian}
    H = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \sigma_{i}^{x} \sigma_{i + 1}^{x}
        + \sigma_{1}^{y} \sigma_{2}^{z} \dotsm \sigma_{n - 1}^{z} \sigma_{n}^{y}
        + \lambda \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \sigma_{i}^{z},
  \end{equation}
  where \( n = 8 \) in our case, and the middle term incorporates finite-size effects with periodic boundary conditions.

  We find the magnetization of the Ising model and its evolution in time for various field strengths~\( \lambda \). To simulate the chain as an open quantum system, we couple the Ising model to a decoherence channel at a single site, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ising-chain-with-environment}.

    \caption{An Ising chain with a bath coupled to one site and periodic boundary conditions.%
      \label{fig:ising-chain-with-environment}}
  \end{figure}
  The open quantum system is simulated with Qiskit using \texttt{ibmq\_qasm\_simulator}.

  \subsection*{Applications}
  Various forms and extensions to the Ising model are well-studied. By comparing results between quantum computers, we can benchmark their accuracy relative to each other and the classical solutions.

  Further, no quantum system is perfectly isolated from the environment. By understanding the effects of various decoherence channels on solutions with quantum simulators, we can characterize the noise channels present in real quantum hardware.

  \section{Quantum Gates}
  The closed system Ising model described by the Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:system-hamiltonian} is diagonalized exactly by applying a unitary disentangling operator~\( U_{\textnormal{dis}} \) such that
  \begin{equation}
    \tilde{H}
      = U_{\textnormal{dis}}^{\dagger} H
        U_{\textnormal{dis}}^{\vphantom{\dagger}},
  \end{equation}
  where \( \tilde{H} \) is a noninteracting Hamiltonian. The method to obtain \( U_{\textnormal{dis}} \) is threefold~\cite{Verstraete2009}.
  \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \item We map spins to fermionic modes with the Jordan--Wigner transform. Fortunately, this transformation is a relabeling only and is idempotent.
    \item The fermionic modes are mapped to momentum space under a Fourier transform.
    \item A Bogoliubov transform decouples the modes in opposite momenta, diagonalizing the system.
  \end{enumerate*}

  \subsection{Fourier Transform}
  We consider only the case \( n = 2^{m} \) for integral \( m \), permitting us to use a fast Fourier transform (FFT). The fast Fourier transform of fermionic modes that we have implemented, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ffft}, is analogous to the standard Cooley--Tukey FFT of digital signal processing~\cite{Cooley1965}.
  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/ffft.png}
    \caption{Fast fermionic Fourier transform on \( 8 \) sites. The two-site circular gates are the Fourier transforms \( F_{2} \). Image adapted from~\cite{Ferris2014}.%
      \label{fig:ffft}}
  \end{figure}
  Fourier transforms on \( n \) sites are decomposed into two-site beam splitters
  \begin{equation}
    F_{2}
      = \begin{pmatrix}
          1 & 0            & \hphantom{-}0            & \hphantom{-}0 \\
          0 & 1 / \sqrt{2} & \hphantom{-}1 / \sqrt{2} & \hphantom{-}0 \\
          0 & 1 / \sqrt{2} &           - 1 / \sqrt{2} & \hphantom{-}0 \\
          0 & 0            & \hphantom{-}0            &           - 1
        \end{pmatrix}
  \end{equation}
  and phase delays
  \begin{equation}
    \omega_{n}^{k}
      = \begin{pmatrix}
          1 & 0 \\
          0 & \eu^{2 \iu \pi k / n}
        \end{pmatrix}
  \end{equation}
  with twiddle factor~\( \eu^{2 \iu \pi k / n} \). The permutations for each site are performed by a series of fermionic swap gates
  \begin{equation}
    \mathrm{fSWAP}
      = \begin{pmatrix}
          1 & 0 & 0 & \hphantom{-}0 \\
          0 & 0 & 1 & \hphantom{-}0 \\
          0 & 1 & 0 & \hphantom{-}0 \\
          0 & 0 & 0 &           - 1
        \end{pmatrix}
  \end{equation}
  that maintain the required exchange statistics through the element \( -1 \).

  \subsection{Bogoliubov Transform}
  The Hamiltonian in momentum is disentangled by a Bogoliubov transform. The gate implementing such a transformation is given by
  \begin{equation}
    B_{k}^{n}
      = \begin{pmatrix}
          \hphantom{\iu} \cos(\theta_{k} / 2)
                           & 0 & 0 &           \iu  \sin(\theta_{k} / 2) \\
          \hphantom{\iu} 0 & 1 & 0 & \hphantom{\iu} 0 \\
          \hphantom{\iu} 0 & 0 & 1 & \hphantom{\iu} 0 \\
                    \iu  \sin(\theta_{k} / 2)
                           & 0 & 0 & \hphantom{\iu} \cos(\theta_{k} / 2)
      \end{pmatrix}
  \end{equation}
  where
  \begin{equation}
    \theta_{k}
      = \arccos
        \frac{\lambda - \cos \qfrac{2 \pi k}{n}}
             {\sqrt{\biggl( \lambda - \cos \qfrac*{2 \pi k}{n} \biggr)^{2}
              + \sin^{2} \qfrac*{2 \pi k}{n}}}.
  \end{equation}

  To solve the Ising model on a quantum computer, we follow these steps in the reverse order, starting in the computational basis and then implementing \( U_{\textnormal{dis}}^{\dagger} \).

  \section{Time Evolution}
  The time evolution of a given state~\( \ket{\psi_{0}} \) under the time-independent Hamiltonian~\( H \) is described by the unitary operator~\( U(t) = \eu^{-\iu t H} \). Specifically,
  \begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi(t)}
      = U(t) \ket{\psi_{0}}
      = \sum_{i} \eu^{-\iu t \epsilon_{i}} \ket{E_{i}} \braket{E_{i}}{\psi_{0}},
  \end{equation}
  where \( \epsilon_{i} \) is the energy of the corresponding state \( \ket{E_{i}} \). For any observable \( M \) such that \( [H, M] \neq 0 \), the expectation value \( \langle M \rangle \) oscillates in time, given by
  \begin{align}
    \MoveEqLeft[1] \langle M(t) \rangle \notag \\
      &= \sum_{i, j} \eu^{-\iu t (\epsilon_{i} - \epsilon_{j})}
         \braket{\psi_{0}}{E_{j}} \bra{E_{j}} M \ket{E_{i}}
         \braket{E_{i}}{\psi_{0}}.
  \end{align}

  We now have computational basis states from the eigenstates of \( \tilde{H} \) and energies~\( \epsilon_{i} \). We can construct the time evolution of the transverse magnetization \( \langle \sigma_{z} \rangle \) by expressing \( \ket{\psi_{0}} \) in the computational basis and then adding the corresponding factors~\( \eu^{-\iu t \epsilon_{i}} \). The analytic expression is given by
  \begin{equation}
    \langle \sigma_{z} \rangle
      = \frac{1 + 2 \lambda^{2} + \cos \bigl( 4 t \sqrt{1 + \lambda^{2}} \bigr)}
             {2 + 2 \lambda^{2}}.
  \end{equation}

  \section{Open Quantum Channels}
  Having solved the closed system, we couple a site to a bath and apply two decoherence channels, amplitude damping and depolarizing, across the coupling to observe the change in magnetization over time.

  \subsection{Amplitude Damping}
  For an arbitrary pure state of the system \( \ket{\psi}_{s} = \alpha \ket{0}_{s} + \beta \ket{1}_{s} \), letting the state of the environment be vacuum \( \ket{0}_{e} \), two gates between the system and environment qubits transform the joint state into
  \begin{equation*}
    \alpha \ket{0}_{1} \ket{0}_{2} + \beta \cos \theta \ket{1}_{1} \ket{0}_{2}
    + \beta \sin \theta \ket{0}_{1} \ket{1}_{2},
  \end{equation*}
  where \( q_{1} \) and \( q_{2} \) are the system and environment qubits, respectively. Therefore, identifying the states~\( \ket{0}_{1} \) and~\( \ket{1}_{1} \) with the ground state and excited states, and choosing \( \cos \theta = c_{1}(t) \), we get a reduced state of the system such that
  \begin{equation}
    \rho_{s}(t)
      = \begin{pmatrix}
          \lvert c_{1}^{}(t) \rvert^{2} & c_{0}^{*} c_{1}^{}(t)             \\
          c_{0}^{} c_{1}^{*}(t)         & 1 - \lvert c_{1}^{}(t) \rvert^{2}
        \end{pmatrix}.
  \end{equation}
  The factors \( c_{0} \) and \( c_{1} \) are time-dependent factors of the wave equation. Further, we have a decay rate
  \begin{equation}
    \gamma(t) = -2 \Re \biggl( \frac{\dot{c}_{1}(t)}{c_{1}(t)} \biggr),
  \end{equation}
  where
  \begin{align}
    c_{1}(t)
      = c_{1}(0) \eu^{-\lambda t / 2}
        \biggl(
          \cosh \frac{\lambda t d}{2}
            + \frac{1}{d}
              \sinh \frac{\lambda t d}{2}
        \biggr)
  \end{align}
  for \( d = \sqrt{1 - 2 R} \) and \( R = \gamma_{0} / \lambda \).

  The application of this channel results in a lower average magnetization of the system, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:amplitude-damping-channel}.
  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/amplitude_damping_channel.png}
    \caption{Time evolution of the transverse magnetization with amplitude damping channel lowering average magnetization in time.%
      \label{fig:amplitude-damping-channel}}
  \end{figure}
  Notably, it did not affect amplitude or frequency in time of the magnetization envelope, nor did it show a decay effect on the magnetization.

  \subsection{Depolarizing Channel}
  A depolarization channel applied over time moves the state of the system toward \( I / 2 \). The rate of this decoherence is given by the decay rate parameter~\( \gamma \), which we let be \( 0.5 \) for all runs. Seen in Figures~\ref{fig:depolarization-channel-05}--\ref{fig:depolarization-channel-18}, the magnetization of the system decreases over time while coupled to the system.
  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/depolarization_channel_05.png}
    \caption{Time evolution of the transverse magnetization with \( \lambda = 0.5 \) when coupled to a depolarizing channel.%
      \label{fig:depolarization-channel-05}}
  \end{figure}
  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/depolarization_channel_09.png}
    \caption{Time evolution of the transverse magnetization with \( \lambda = 0.9 \) when coupled to a depolarizing channel.%
      \label{fig:depolarization-channel-09}}
  \end{figure}
  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/depolarization_channel_18.png}
    \caption{Time evolution of the transverse magnetization with \( \lambda = 1.8 \) when coupled to a depolarizing channel.%
      \label{fig:depolarization-channel-18}}
  \end{figure}

  Since the depolarizing channel is only coupled to a single site, the decrease in energy must propagate through the system. However, the effect of the transverse field prevents the system from fully thermalizing, saturating at some nonzero \( \langle \sigma_{z} \rangle \).

  We studied the effects of the depolarizing channel for three field strengths \( \lambda \). The effect of the depolarization channel is most noticeable with higher \( \lambda \), see Figure~\ref{fig:depolarization-channel-18}, but the decrease in magnetization can also be seen in the lower \( \lambda \)'s in Figures~\ref{fig:depolarization-channel-05} and~\ref{fig:depolarization-channel-09}. We also tested the effect of the depolarizing channel over longer times, with stronger decay rate parameters and the notable result was that for strong transverse fields the decay would level out to a nonzero average. This result is seen in Figure~\ref{fig:depolarization-channel-18-long}.

    \caption{Time evolution of the transverse magnetization with \( \lambda = 1.8 \) when coupled to a depolarizing channel with \( \gamma = 0.9 \). This demonstrates the saturation of \( \langle \sigma_{z} \rangle \) above \( 0 \).%

  \end{figure}

  \section{Conclusion}
  Each type of noise affects the Ising model simulation differently, some examples include the amplitude damping channel causes a shift down in the total magnetization and the depolarizing channel causes the magnetization to decay over time. These distinct differences allow us to determine what types of noise are present in a system, and how strong each type is as well. This will be helpful in determining what types of noise and how much noise will need to be worked around in a given quantum computer.
